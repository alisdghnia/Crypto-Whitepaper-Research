      "\n",
      "Filecoin is a protocol token whose blockchain runs on a novel proof, called Proof-of-Spacetime, where blocks\n",
      "are created by miners that are storing data. Filecoin protocol provides a data storage and retrieval service\n",
      "via a network of independent storage providers that does not rely on a single coordinator, where: (1) clients\n",
      "pay to store and retrieve data, (2) Storage Miners earn tokens by oﬀering storage (3) Retrieval Miners earn\n",
      "tokens by serving data.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Elementary Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The Filecoin protocol builds upon four novel components.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Decentralized Storage Network (DSN): We provide an abstraction for network of independent\n",
      "storage providers to oﬀer storage and retrieval services (in Section 2). Later, we present the Filecoin\n",
      "protocol as an incentivized, auditable and veriﬁable DSN construction (in Section 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Novel Proofs-of-Storage: We present two novel Proofs-of-Storage (in Section 3): (1) Proof-of-\n",
      "Replication allows storage providers to prove that data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated\n",
      "physical storage. Enforcing unique physical copies enables a veriﬁer to check that a prover is not\n",
      "deduplicating multiple copies of the data into the same storage space; (2) Proof-of-Spacetime allows\n",
      "storage providers to prove they have stored some data throughout a speciﬁed amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Veriﬁable Markets: We model storage requests and retrieval requests as orders in two decentralized\n",
      "veriﬁable markets operated by the Filecoin network (in Section 5). Veriﬁable markets ensure that\n",
      "payments are performed when a service has been correctly provided. We present the Storage Market\n",
      "and the Retrieval Market where miners and clients can respectively submit storage and retrieval orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Useful Proof-of-Work : We show how to construct a useful Proof-of-Work based on Proof-of-\n",
      "Spacetime that can be used in consensus protocols. Miners do not need to spend wasteful computation\n",
      "to mine blocks, but instead must store data in the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Protocol Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Filecoin protocol is a Decentralized Storage Network construction built on a blockchain and with\n",
      "a native token. Clients spend tokens for storing and retrieving data and miners earn tokens by storing\n",
      "and serving data.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Filecoin DSN handle storage and retrieval requests respectively via two veriﬁable markets: the\n",
      "Storage Market and the Retrieval Market. Clients and miners set the prices for the services requested\n",
      "and oﬀered and submit their orders to the markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The markets are operated by the Filecoin network which employs Proof-of-Spacetime and Proof-of-\n",
      "\n",
      "Replication to guarantee that miners have correctly stored the data they committed to store.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Finally, miners can participate in the creations of new blocks for the underlining blockchain. The\n",
      "inﬂuence of a miner over the next block is proportional to the amount of their storage currently in use\n",
      "in the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sketch of the Filecoin protocol, using nomenclature deﬁned later within the paper, is shown in Figure 1\n",
      "accompanied with an illustration in Figure 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Paper organization\n",
      "\n",
      "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present our deﬁnition of and requirements for a\n",
      "theoretical DSNscheme in Section 2. In Section 3 we motivate, deﬁne, and present our Proof-of-Replication\n",

      "\n",
      "• Achieving Integrity: Pieces are named after their cryptographic hash. After a Put request, clients only\n",
      "need to store this hash to retrieve the data via Get and to verify the integrity of the content received.\n",
      "• Achieving Retrievability: In a Put request, clients specify the replication factor and the type of erasure\n",
      "coding desired, specifying in this way the storage to be (f, m)-tolerant. The assumption is that given\n",
      "m Storage Miners storing the data, a maximum of f faults are tolerated. By storing data in more than\n",
      "one Storage Miner, a client can increase the chances of recovery, in case Storage Miners go oﬄine or\n",

      "• Achieving Public Veriﬁability and Auditability: Storage Miners are required to submit their proofs of\n",

      "proofs, without having access to the outsourced data. Since the proofs are stored on the blockchain,\n",
      "they are a trace of operation that can be audited at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Achieving Incentive Compatibility: Informally, miners are rewarded for the storage they are providing.\n",
      "When miners commit to store some data, then they are required to generate proofs. Miners that skip\n",
      "proofs are penalized (by losing part of their collateral) and not rewarded for their storage.\n",

      "Deﬁnition 5.1. A veriﬁable Market is a protocol with two phases: order matching and settlement. Orders\n",

      "guaranteeing in this way commitment and availability of funds during settlement.\n",

      "Unlike Storage Miners, Retrieval Miners are not required to store pieces through time or generate proofs of\n",
      "storage. Any user in the network can become a Retrieval Miner by serving pieces in exchange for Filecoin\n",

      "5.3.1 Requirements\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "• Oﬀ-chain orderbook: Clients must be able to ﬁnd Retrieval Miners that are serving the required\n",
      "pieces and directly exchange the pieces, after settling on the pricing. This means that the orderbook\n",
      "cannot be run via the blockchain - since this would be the bottleneck for fast retrieval requests - instead\n",
      "participant will have only partial view of the OrderBook. Hence, we require both parties to gossip their\n",

      "it is impossible for two parties to perform an exchange without trusted parties. In the Storage Market,\n",
      "the blockchain network acts as a (decentralized) trusted party that veriﬁes the storage provided by\n",
      "the Storage Miners. In the Retrieval Market, Retrieval Miners and clients exchange data without the\n",
      "network witnessing the exchange of ﬁle. We go around this result by requiring the Retrieval Miner to\n",
      "split their data in multiple parts and for each part sent to the client, they receive a payment. In this\n",
      "way, if the client stops paying, or the miner stops sending data, either party can halt the exchange.\n",
      "Note that for this to work, we must assume that there is always one honest Retrieval Miner.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Payments channels: Clients are interested in retrieving the pieces as soon as they submit their\n",
      "payments, Retrieval Miners are interested in only serving the pieces if they are sure of receiving a\n",
      "payment. Validating payments via a public ledger can be the bottleneck of a retrieval request, hence\n",
      "we must rely on eﬃcient oﬀ-chain payments. The Filecoin blockchain must support payment channels\n",

      "While securing the blockchain is of fundamental importance, Proof-of-Work schemes often require solving\n",

      "\n",
      "Filecoin is a protocol token whose blockchain runs on a novel proof, called Proof-of-Spacetime, where blocks\n",
      "are created by miners that are storing data. Filecoin protocol provides a data storage and retrieval service\n",
      "via a network of independent storage providers that does not rely on a single coordinator, where: (1) clients\n",
      "pay to store and retrieve data, (2) Storage Miners earn tokens by oﬀering storage (3) Retrieval Miners earn\n",
      "tokens by serving data.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Elementary Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The Filecoin protocol builds upon four novel components.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Decentralized Storage Network (DSN): We provide an abstraction for network of independent\n",
      "storage providers to oﬀer storage and retrieval services (in Section 2). Later, we present the Filecoin\n",
      "protocol as an incentivized, auditable and veriﬁable DSN construction (in Section 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Novel Proofs-of-Storage: We present two novel Proofs-of-Storage (in Section 3): (1) Proof-of-\n",
      "Replication allows storage providers to prove that data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated\n",
      "physical storage. Enforcing unique physical copies enables a veriﬁer to check that a prover is not\n",
      "deduplicating multiple copies of the data into the same storage space; (2) Proof-of-Spacetime allows\n",
      "storage providers to prove they have stored some data throughout a speciﬁed amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Veriﬁable Markets: We model storage requests and retrieval requests as orders in two decentralized\n",
      "veriﬁable markets operated by the Filecoin network (in Section 5). Veriﬁable markets ensure that\n",
      "payments are performed when a service has been correctly provided. We present the Storage Market\n",
      "and the Retrieval Market where miners and clients can respectively submit storage and retrieval orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Useful Proof-of-Work : We show how to construct a useful Proof-of-Work based on Proof-of-\n",
      "Spacetime that can be used in consensus protocols. Miners do not need to spend wasteful computation\n",
      "to mine blocks, but instead must store data in the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Protocol Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Filecoin protocol is a Decentralized Storage Network construction built on a blockchain and with\n",
      "a native token. Clients spend tokens for storing and retrieving data and miners earn tokens by storing\n",
      "and serving data.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Filecoin DSN handle storage and retrieval requests respectively via two veriﬁable markets: the\n",
      "Storage Market and the Retrieval Market. Clients and miners set the prices for the services requested\n",
      "and oﬀered and submit their orders to the markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The markets are operated by the Filecoin network which employs Proof-of-Spacetime and Proof-of-\n",
      "\n",
      "Replication to guarantee that miners have correctly stored the data they committed to store.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Finally, miners can participate in the creations of new blocks for the underlining blockchain. The\n",
      "inﬂuence of a miner over the next block is proportional to the amount of their storage currently in use\n",
      "in the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sketch of the Filecoin protocol, using nomenclature deﬁned later within the paper, is shown in Figure 1\n",
      "accompanied with an illustration in Figure 2.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present our deﬁnition of and requirements for a\n",

      "• Achieving Integrity: Pieces are named after their cryptographic hash. After a Put request, clients only\n",

      "• Achieving Retrievability: In a Put request, clients specify the replication factor and the type of erasure\n",

      "m Storage Miners storing the data, a maximum of f faults are tolerated. By storing data in more than\n",

      "proofs, without having access to the outsourced data. Since the proofs are stored on the blockchain,\n",

      "When miners commit to store some data, then they are required to generate proofs. Miners that skip\n",
      "proofs are penalized (by losing part of their collateral) and not rewarded for their storage.\n",

      "a decentralized network of participants must be able to verify the exchange between buyers and sellers.\n",

      "transparent, and anybody can participate pseudonymously. Veriﬁable Market protocols operate the exchange\n",
      "of goods/services in a decentralized fashion: consistency of the orderbooks, orders settlements and correct\n",
      "execution of services are independently veriﬁed via the participants - miners and full nodes in the case of\n",
      "Filecoin. We simplify veriﬁable markets to have the following construction:\n",
      "\n",
      "Deﬁnition 5.1. A veriﬁable Market is a protocol with two phases: order matching and settlement. Orders\n",

      "1. Participants add buy orders and sell orders to the orderbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When two orders match, involved parties jointly create a deal order that commits the two parties to\n",
      "\n",
      "the exchange, and propagate it to the network by adding it to the orderbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The network ensures that the transfer of goods or services has been executed correctly, by requiring\n",
      "\n",
      "sellers to generate cryptographic proofs for their exchange/service.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. On success, the network processes the payments and clears the orders from the orderbook.\n",

      "having available funds. In order to participate to the Storage Market, Storage Miners must pledge,\n",
      "depositing a collateral proportional to their amount of storage in DSN (see Section 4.3.3 for more\n",
      "details). In this way, the Network can penalize Storage Miners that do not provide proofs of storage\n",
      "for the pieces they committed to store. Similarly, clients must deposit the funds speciﬁed in the order,\n",
      "guaranteeing in this way commitment and availability of funds during settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Self-organization to handle faults: Orders are only settled if Storage Miners have repeatedly\n",
      "proved that they have stored the pieces for the duration of the agreed-upon time period. The Network\n",
      "must be able to verify the existence and the correctness of these proofs and act according to the rules\n",

      "\n",
      "The Retrieval Market allows clients to request retrieval of a speciﬁc piece and Retrieval Miners to serve it.\n",
      "Unlike Storage Miners, Retrieval Miners are not required to store pieces through time or generate proofs of\n",
      "storage. Any user in the network can become a Retrieval Miner by serving pieces in exchange for Filecoin\n",
      "tokens. Retrieval Miners can obtain pieces by receiving them directly from clients, by acquiring them from\n",
      "the Retrieval Market, or by storing them from being a Storage Miner.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3.1 Requirements\n",

      "pieces and directly exchange the pieces, after settling on the pricing. This means that the orderbook\n",
      "cannot be run via the blockchain - since this would be the bottleneck for fast retrieval requests - instead\n",
      "participant will have only partial view of the OrderBook. Hence, we require both parties to gossip their\n",

      "• Retrieval without trusted parties: The impossibility results on fair exchange [10] remind us that\n",
      "it is impossible for two parties to perform an exchange without trusted parties. In the Storage Market,\n",
      "the blockchain network acts as a (decentralized) trusted party that veriﬁes the storage provided by\n",
      "the Storage Miners. In the Retrieval Market, Retrieval Miners and clients exchange data without the\n",
      "network witnessing the exchange of ﬁle. We go around this result by requiring the Retrieval Miner to\n",
      "split their data in multiple parts and for each part sent to the client, they receive a payment. In this\n",
      "way, if the client stops paying, or the miner stops sending data, either party can halt the exchange.\n",
      "Note that for this to work, we must assume that there is always one honest Retrieval Miner.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Payments channels: Clients are interested in retrieving the pieces as soon as they submit their\n",
      "payments, Retrieval Miners are interested in only serving the pieces if they are sure of receiving a\n",
      "payment. Validating payments via a public ledger can be the bottleneck of a retrieval request, hence\n",
