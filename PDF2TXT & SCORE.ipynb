      "\n",
      "some of which we are going to outline in this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 Formal veriﬁcation\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of its existence Ethereum has had many ﬂaws of deployed\n",
      "contracts uncovered and abused. Some of these were simple developer errors\n",
      "and others very subtle due to the complexity of both the EVM and Solidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formal veriﬁcation is one of the approaches to prevent these problems by al-\n",
      "lowing code to be proven correctly with regards to a given speciﬁcation. Formal\n",
      "veriﬁcation is used in many areas where high assurance is of vital importance,\n",
      "e.g.\n",
      "cryptographic systems. Take the parity multi-sig contract ﬂaw, which\n",
      "allowed anyone to destroy one of the libraries used by the multi-sig contract\n",
      "rendering it useless, as an example. A formal speciﬁcation of this contract\n",
      "could include the assumption that destruction functions can only be called by\n",
      "authorized accounts or not at all. Checking this speciﬁcation against the code\n",
      "would then have raised an error. But there is certainly still the problem of\n",
      "writing good speciﬁcations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sophia was written with formal veriﬁcation in mind, we have laid most\n",
      "of the ground work required to provide these tools. Together with Sophia being\n",
      "a functional language, this should prevent many classes of bugs plaguing Solidity\n",
      "smart contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Native tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "The ERC-20 standard, which speciﬁed an interface for fungible tokens, was\n",
      "arguably one of the biggest drivers of adoption for Ethereum. With that came\n",
      "the ability for anyone to design and test economic systems, which was a great\n",
      "catalyst for the innovation happening on Ethereum. A big drawback of the\n",
      "token contracts deployed was and still is the requirement to pay gas and thus\n",
      "own Eth, which can be a major hurdle for users, who don’t necessarily want\n",
      "to own any Eth or even know what that is. In addition to that, interacting or\n",
      "integrating with token can be a pain, especially since the interface evolved over\n",
      "time and if upgradability was not baked into the contract there are only very\n",
      "clumsy upgrade paths for old contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these drawbacks, æternity will make tokens native to the blockchain.\n",
      "\n",
      "That opens the way to be able to use tokens to pay transaction fees, which frees\n",
      "users from the requirement to own any other tokens. It will make usage cheaper\n",
      "since the basic token logic and storage can be optimized in the virtual machine.\n",
      "Finally, this will allow tokens to beneﬁt from updates and upgrades for free,\n",
      "without needing complex upgrade strategies.\n",

      "\n",
      "Computational integrity assures that a given function was computed correctly.\n",
      "This could mean that a coin transfer correctly deducts coins from one account\n",
      "while adding it to another or the correct execution of a smart contract call.\n",
      "Currently assuring these correct executions is done by miners and node operators\n",
      "via complex consensus rules. It also requires everyone who wants to check the\n",
      "correct execution to re-run the full computation, which could be very costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are diﬀerent ways that allow checking the integrity of a function ex-\n",
      "ecution but we are going to assume that the prover, the agent running the\n",
      "computation and trying to prove that they executed it correctly, can generate a\n",
      "succinct proof. Succinctness implies that checking the proof is computationally\n",
      "less expensive than actually re-running the computation. This proof can then\n",
      "be read and validated by another party, the veriﬁer, who wants to check the\n",
      "integrity of the computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of such primitives then allows scaling, since checking the proof\n",
      "takes less resources than running the computation. Additionally, these proofs\n",
      "can be generated in such a way that the function itself can be private, while\n",
      "still being veriﬁable by a third party, which would be a big gain in privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia already comes with some primitives to write eﬃcient proof veriﬁers\n",
      "and in the future we want to integrate these primitives even further into the\n",

      "more relevant as usability improves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another direction to go is to split the blockchain into distinct parts, which\n",
      "is also common for databases. These parts are then called shards and each one\n",
      "will then be responsible for only a subset of all available transactions. Dividing\n",
      "up the work like this would then oﬀer each shard more room to scale just by\n",
      "virtue of only having to handle a fraction of the previous load. Shards will still\n",
      "have to communicate with each other, which is a possible bottleneck, and have\n",

      "6.1 Formal veriﬁcation\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of its existence Ethereum has had many ﬂaws of deployed\n",
      "contracts uncovered and abused. Some of these were simple developer errors\n",
      "and others very subtle due to the complexity of both the EVM and Solidity.\n",

      "lowing code to be proven correctly with regards to a given speciﬁcation. Formal\n",
      "veriﬁcation is used in many areas where high assurance is of vital importance,\n",
      "e.g.\n",
      "cryptographic systems. Take the parity multi-sig contract ﬂaw, which\n",
      "allowed anyone to destroy one of the libraries used by the multi-sig contract\n",
      "rendering it useless, as an example. A formal speciﬁcation of this contract\n",
      "could include the assumption that destruction functions can only be called by\n",
      "authorized accounts or not at all. Checking this speciﬁcation against the code\n",
      "would then have raised an error. But there is certainly still the problem of\n",
      "writing good speciﬁcations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Sophia was written with formal veriﬁcation in mind, we have laid most\n",
      "of the ground work required to provide these tools. Together with Sophia being\n",
      "a functional language, this should prevent many classes of bugs plaguing Solidity\n",
      "smart contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Native tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "The ERC-20 standard, which speciﬁed an interface for fungible tokens, was\n",
      "arguably one of the biggest drivers of adoption for Ethereum. With that came\n",
      "the ability for anyone to design and test economic systems, which was a great\n",
      "catalyst for the innovation happening on Ethereum. A big drawback of the\n",
      "token contracts deployed was and still is the requirement to pay gas and thus\n",
      "own Eth, which can be a major hurdle for users, who don’t necessarily want\n",
      "to own any Eth or even know what that is. In addition to that, interacting or\n",
      "integrating with token can be a pain, especially since the interface evolved over\n",
      "time and if upgradability was not baked into the contract there are only very\n",
      "clumsy upgrade paths for old contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these drawbacks, æternity will make tokens native to the blockchain.\n",
      "\n",
      "That opens the way to be able to use tokens to pay transaction fees, which frees\n",
      "users from the requirement to own any other tokens. It will make usage cheaper\n",
      "since the basic token logic and storage can be optimized in the virtual machine.\n",

      "This could mean that a coin transfer correctly deducts coins from one account\n",
      "while adding it to another or the correct execution of a smart contract call.\n",
      "Currently assuring these correct executions is done by miners and node operators\n",
      "via complex consensus rules. It also requires everyone who wants to check the\n",

      "\n",
      "There are diﬀerent ways that allow checking the integrity of a function ex-\n",
      "ecution but we are going to assume that the prover, the agent running the\n",
      "computation and trying to prove that they executed it correctly, can generate a\n",
      "succinct proof. Succinctness implies that checking the proof is computationally\n",
      "less expensive than actually re-running the computation. This proof can then\n",
      "be read and validated by another party, the veriﬁer, who wants to check the\n",
      "integrity of the computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of such primitives then allows scaling, since checking the proof\n",
      "takes less resources than running the computation. Additionally, these proofs\n",
      "can be generated in such a way that the function itself can be private, while\n",
      "still being veriﬁable by a third party, which would be a big gain in privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia already comes with some primitives to write eﬃcient proof veriﬁers\n",
      "and in the future we want to integrate these primitives even further into the\n",

      "\n",
      "Another direction to go is to split the blockchain into distinct parts, which\n",
      "is also common for databases. These parts are then called shards and each one\n",
      "will then be responsible for only a subset of all available transactions. Dividing\n",
      "up the work like this would then oﬀer each shard more room to scale just by\n",
      "virtue of only having to handle a fraction of the previous load. Shards will still\n",
      "have to communicate with each other, which is a possible bottleneck, and have\n",
