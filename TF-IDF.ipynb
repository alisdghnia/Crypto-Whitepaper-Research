      "By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \n",

      "a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. \n",
      "The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending \n",
      "resources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is \n",

      "the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of \n",
      "ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.   To solve this, we \n",
      "proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions \n",
      "that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes \n",
      "control a majority of CPU power.  The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.  Nodes \n",
      "work all at once with little coordination.  They do not need to be identified, since messages are \n",
      "not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can \n",
      "leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   proof-of-work   chain   as   proof   of   what \n",
      "happened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of \n",
      "valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on \n",
      "them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\n",
